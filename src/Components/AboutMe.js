                <h3 id="aboutDesc">I've always had an interest in tech, minoring in Computer Science and working in the IT department at my school. I decided to take a leap and am now in the software engineering program at the coding bootcamp, Flatiron School. My last day is Aug. 5, and I am currently looking for a position as a software developer. While my skills are in both frontend and backend programming, my passion lies with frontend development, where I am able to work more creatively. </h3>
