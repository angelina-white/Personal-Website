                <h4 id="aboutDesc">I've always had an interest in tech, minoring in computer science and working in the IT department at my school. I love learning new programming languages and skills to apply to my work. Iâ€™m currently learning React Native. I just completed a coding bootcamp for software engineering and am searching for a new job as a full stack developer or front end developer.</h4>
